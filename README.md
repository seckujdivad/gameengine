OpenGL renderer using wxWidgets components.

## Dependencies
### vcpkg
* nlohmann-json
* wxwidgets
* glm
* glew
* opengl
### NuGet

Google Test is only required for building and running the unit tests. If you don't want to use these, it is not required.

64-bit compilation is supported, but you will need to download 64-bit versions of the vcpkg dependencies to your machine. vcpkg can be downloaded and set up from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vcpkg).
